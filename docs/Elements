INTRODUCTION
------------

    This file outlines the elements contained on a page and how to customise
    these.

LOGO
----

    This should be a transparent ping.
    The name and location of the logo is contained within public stylesheet.

TOP MENU
--------

    Generated from the navigation array in the application.ini

    Adding the flag:
        resources.navigation.pages.contact.topmenu = 1
    to a navigation element will place it on the Top Menu, and remove it from the main navigation.

    The top menu uses the custom topmenu.phtml partial in the layout selected.

    This also utilises the language file for the naming of each link.

NAVIGATION TABS
---------------

    Generated from the navigation array in the application.ini

    The menu uses the custom menu.phtml partial in the layout selected.

    This also utilises the language file for the naming of each link.
